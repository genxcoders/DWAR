1) The code of the Uploading of XLS file is ready for you. You need to change          header format XLS sheet as per coding format requirement.

2) It will take some time to generate the report as the report is being brought        from different pages.And I had talked with Jalali sir(25/06/2019) about the         report generation, then he had said that he would share his logic.So I am          waiting for his mail.

3) In the other hand I am working on the Midnight position module, just work on its    delete view and list view.And remaining modules are already uploaded online.

4) The report that was created before it was made manually in XLS Sheet, it would      take some time to create the code through it.

5) Schedule a meeting for training when you have all your Employees present.
